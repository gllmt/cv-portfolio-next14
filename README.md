# CV - Website with Next.js 14, Typescript, TailwindCSS.

[![cv-pierre-2024](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxgf6ohvo/image/upload/v1718108977/Perso/caption-cv-pierre-2024_ib29fl.webp)](https://cv-pierre-2024.vercel.app/)

This project is a basic test to demonstrate how to use Next.js 14 with server components, context, and other new features in the [Next.js](https://vercel.com/) app router.

For this project, I also utilized the following technologies: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), [React Email](https://react.email/), and [Resend](https://resend.com/).

I'm using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to build and host my code. Feel free to use your favorite CDN.
